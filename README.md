**To-Do List App:**
---
This repository contains code for creating a simple To-Do List application using Python and Streamlit. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks and clearing the task list. The tasks are stored in a CSV file for persistence.

**Usage:**
To use the To-Do List application, you can follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install streamlit
```
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

cd to-do-list
Run the application using Streamlit:

streamlit run main.py
A web app will open in your browser, displaying the To-Do List interface.

To add a new task, type the task description in the "Add a new task" input box and click the "Add" button.

To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task.

To clear all tasks, click the "Clear all tasks" button.
